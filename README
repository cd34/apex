THIS BREAKS ALL BACKWARDS COMPATIBILITY.

This means that existing auth systems need to be modified - check the install 
instructions as you'll need to slightly modify your SQL, do some imports,

* Authentication

Authentication has a single authentication id which can have multiple
associated credentials. A user can create a username and associate their
Facebook and Google login records with their current record and log in
with any of them. It is planned that Apex will act as an endpoint for
multi-domain multi-site installations - allowing one to associate a login
account from one domain to another.

Local authentication uses salt + BCrypt
