   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to Apex's documentation!
================================

::

    WARNING!!! Velruse has changed substantially.  Apex acts more as a
    wrapper to Velruse since Velruse brought in a lot of functionality
    and now has Pyramid as a dependency. In addition, Apex has been
    modified to allow a single Auth Identity to have multiple
    authentication providers. 

    Currently, Twitter has an odd connection close bug related to paste.http,
    Mac OS/X Lion and webkit enabled browsers. Using CherryPy for development 
    will work around this.

::

    [server:main]
    #use = egg:Paste#http
    use = egg:PasteScript#cherrypy
    host = 0.0.0.0
    port = 8080

**Quick Overview**

Apex is a framework that works on top of Pyramid_ focused on simplifying
authentication, but, also activating a number of other features. Apex
has a single user model and encourages you to use a Foreign Key relation
to any Profile information you would like to store.

**What is included?**

Authentication, Form Library, I18N/L10N, Flash Message Template

Uses pyramid_routesalchemy

**Authentication**

  * Local authentication uses salt + BCrypt
  * http://codahale.com/how-to-safely-store-a-password/

Velruse_ is used for OpenID/OpenAuth providers and supports:
  * Google
  * Facebook
  * Twitter
  * Yahoo
  * Microsoft Live
  * Bitbucket
  * Github
  * Identi.ca
  * Last.fm
  * LinkedIn
  * Any OpenID provider

Ability to overload the login form, extend the AuthUser class through
a Foreign Key user profile table.

**Form Library**

WTForms_ is used to help those transitioning over from Django to Pyramid.

**I18N/L10N**

Babel_ is used to support Internationalization and Localization.

**Flash Messages**

Templates and helpers for Mako_ and Jinja2_ are included to support Flash
Messages in your application.
